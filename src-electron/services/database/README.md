# Knowlex Database Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive database architecture implementation for the Knowlex desktop application. The implementation includes SQLite for metadata storage, vector database capabilities for RAG functionality, and robust integrity checking and repair mechanisms.

## Architecture Components

### 1. SQLiteManager (`sqlite.manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Manages the main SQLite database for application metadata.

**Key Features**:
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode enabled for better concurrency
- Global write lock mechanism to prevent conflicts
- Comprehensive migration system with version tracking
- Full-text search (FTS5) integration for message content
- Database integrity checking and repair capabilities
- Foreign key constraint enforcement

**Database Schema**:
- `projects`: Project management
- `conversations`: Chat sessions
- `messages`: Chat messages with FTS support
- `files`: File metadata and processing status
- `project_memories`: Project-specific memory storage
- `project_knowledge`: Knowledge base entries
- `app_settings`: Application configuration
- `rerank_settings`: Reranking model configuration
- `migrations`: Schema version tracking

### 2. VectorManager (`vector.manager.ts`)

**Purpose**: Manages vector storage for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality.

**Key Features**:
- hnswsqlite integration with fallback to basic vector storage
- Efficient vector serialization/deserialization
- Cosine similarity search implementation
- Partition management for large vector datasets
- Incremental vector index updates
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

**Vector Operations**:
- Document insertion with embedding storage
- Similarity search with configurable thresholds
- Batch operations for performance
- Orphaned vector cleanup
- Vector count and statistics tracking

### 3. DatabaseService (`database.service.ts`)

**Purpose**: Unified service layer coordinating SQLite and Vector managers.

**Key Features**:
- Centralized initialization and configuration
- Cross-database integrity checking
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Backup and maintenance operations
- Graceful error handling and recovery

### 4. DatabaseIntegrityService (`integrity.service.ts`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive database health monitoring and repair system.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-level integrity checking (basic, detailed, cross-database)
- Automatic repair mechanisms for common issues
- Database backup and restore functionality
- Health metrics and performance monitoring
- Scheduled integrity checks
- Orphaned data cleanup

## Implementation Details

### Migration System

The database uses a robust migration system that:
- Tracks applied migrations in a dedicated table
- Supports incremental schema updates
- Provides rollback capabilities (where applicable)
- Ensures data integrity during migrations

**Current Migrations**:
1. **v1 - Initial Schema**: Creates all base tables and relationships
2. **v2 - Indexes**: Adds performance indexes for common queries
3. **v3 - FTS Tables**: Sets up full-text search with triggers

### Vector Storage Strategy

The implementation provides two vector storage approaches:

1. **Primary**: hnswsqlite extension for high-performance vector search
2. **Fallback**: Binary blob storage with brute-force similarity search

This dual approach ensures cross-platform compatibility even when the hnswsqlite extension is not available.

### Write Lock Mechanism

To prevent database corruption in a multi-threaded environment:
- Global write lock ensures sequential write operations
- Read operations can proceed concurrently
- Transaction-based operations are atomic
- Timeout handling prevents deadlocks

### Full-Text Search Integration

FTS5 integration provides:
- Unicode-aware tokenization for Chinese and English text
- Automatic index maintenance via triggers
- Snippet generation with highlighting
- Optimized search performance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- **SQLiteManager Tests**: 36 test cases covering initialization, operations, integrity, and cross-platform compatibility
- **VectorManager Tests**: Vector operations, search functionality, error handling, and performance
- **IntegrityService Tests**: Full integrity checks, backup/restore, health metrics, and error scenarios

### Cross-Platform Testing

The `scripts/test-cross-platform.js` script verifies:
- better-sqlite3 installation and basic operations
- hnswsqlite extension loading with fallback handling
- Database unit test execution
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage monitoring

### Performance Benchmarks

Current performance metrics:
- **Insert Performance**: 1000 records in ~1ms (with transactions)
- **Query Performance**: Count queries in <1ms
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal heap increase for large operations
- **Vector Search**: Sub-second response for typical datasets

## Configuration Options

### SQLiteManager Configuration

```typescript
interface DatabaseConfig {
  dbPath: string           // Database file path
  enableWAL: boolean      // Enable WAL mode (recommended: true)
  enableForeignKeys: boolean // Enable FK constraints (recommended: true)
  busyTimeout: number     // Timeout for busy database (recommended: 30000ms)
}
```

### VectorManager Configuration

```typescript
interface VectorConfig {
  dbPath: string          // Vector database path
  dimension: number       // Vector dimension (default: 768)
  maxElements: number     // Maximum vectors (default: 1M)
  efConstruction: number  // HNSW construction parameter (default: 200)
  m: number              // HNSW connectivity parameter (default: 16)
}
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Automatic Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Database Corruption**: VACUUM and integrity repair
2. **Orphaned Vectors**: Automatic cleanup during integrity checks
3. **FTS Inconsistency**: Index rebuilding
4. **Foreign Key Violations**: Constraint validation and repair

### Backup and Restore

- **Automatic Backups**: Scheduled backup creation
- **Integrity Verification**: Post-restore validation
- **Emergency Recovery**: Fallback to previous backup on failure
- **Checksum Validation**: Backup integrity verification

## Performance Optimizations

### SQLite Optimizations

- WAL mode for better concurrency
- Optimized cache size (64MB)
- Memory-mapped I/O (256MB)
- Query optimization with ANALYZE
- Proper indexing strategy

### Vector Optimizations

- Efficient binary serialization
- Partition-based loading for large datasets
- Batch operations for bulk inserts
- Lazy loading of vector data
- Memory-efficient similarity calculations

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
