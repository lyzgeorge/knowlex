# What's Built vs What's Missing

**Quick Status**: The core chat app works great! Project management and advanced features need UI work.

## 📱 What Team Members Can Use Right Now

The AI chat system is fully functional and ready for daily use. All the backend infrastructure for advanced features is ready - we just need to build the user interfaces.

## ✅ Complete & Working

### 💬 Chat System
**Everything works - you can use this daily:**
- Send messages and get AI responses with streaming
- Upload files (text, markdown, office docs) into conversations
- Edit and regenerate messages
- Copy responses to clipboard
- See AI "reasoning" process for o1 models
- Auto-scroll that respects user scrolling

### 🤖 AI Integration  
**Multiple AI providers work out of the box:**
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, o1 reasoning models
- **Compatible APIs**: Any OpenAI-compatible service (Groq, SiliconFlow, etc.)
- **Streaming**: Real-time responses as AI types
- **Reasoning**: See AI thought process before final answer
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when things go wrong
- **Files**: AI can read uploaded text files and images

### 💾 Database & Storage
**All data storage is working:**
- **SQLite Database**: Stores all conversations, projects, files
- **Search Ready**: Full-text search across all content
- **Vector Storage**: Infrastructure ready for smart file search
- **Migrations**: Database updates automatically when needed
- **Backup**: Everything stored locally (no cloud dependency)

### ⚡ App Performance & State
**Fast and responsive:**
- **Theme Switching**: Instant dark/light mode switching
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates instantly as AI responds  
- **Memory Efficient**: Handles long conversations without slowdown
- **Settings Saved**: All preferences saved automatically

## 🏗️ What's Built But Needs UI

**Good news**: All the hard backend work is done! We just need to build user interfaces.

### 📁 Project Management (Backend ✅, UI ❌)
**What works behind the scenes:**
- Create, delete, and organize projects
- Store project files and metadata
- Track project statistics and usage

**What we need to build:**
- Project list and selection interface
- Project settings and file management screens
- Visual project organization tools

### ⚙️ Settings System (Backend ✅, UI ❌)
**What works behind the scenes:**
- Save AI model preferences (which models to use)
- Store app preferences (theme, behavior settings)
- Validate all configuration automatically

**What we need to build:**
- Settings screens for AI configuration
- General preferences interface
- Import/export settings functionality

## ❌ What Needs to Be Built

### 🔍 Smart Search System
**The Big Feature We're Missing:**
- Search across all project files intelligently (not just keyword matching)
- AI-powered search that understands context and meaning
- Find relevant information even if exact words don't match

**Technical Status:**
- Database ready for vector storage ✅
- Need to build: file processing pipeline, embedding generation, search interface

### 📂 File Management for Projects  
**Currently Missing:**
- Upload files to specific projects (not just chat)
- Organize and manage project files
- Turn uploaded files into searchable knowledge base

**What to Build:**
- File upload interface for projects
- File organization and tagging system
- Integration with smart search system

## 🎯 Priority Order for Development

### 🥇 Phase 1: Essential UI (1-2 weeks)
1. **Settings Screen** - Let users configure AI models and preferences
2. **Project Management** - Basic project creation and organization
3. **File Manager** - Upload and organize files within projects

### 🥈 Phase 2: Smart Features (2-3 weeks)  
1. **File Processing** - Turn uploaded files into searchable content
2. **Vector Search** - AI-powered search across project knowledge
3. **RAG Integration** - Use project files as context for AI responses

### 🥉 Phase 3: Polish (1-2 weeks)
1. **Advanced Search** - Filters, sorting, advanced queries
2. **Export/Import** - Project templates and data portability
3. **Performance** - Optimization for large projects

## 🛠️ For Developers

### What's Working Well
- **Modern Stack**: React, TypeScript, Electron - all up to date
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK makes adding new AI providers easy
- **Database**: SQLite with full-text search and vector storage ready
- **State Management**: Zustand keeps everything fast and predictable
- **UI Components**: Chakra UI provides consistent, accessible interface

### Recent Technical Improvements
- **Better AI**: Switched to Vercel AI SDK (more reliable than custom implementation)
- **Reasoning Display**: New UI component shows AI thinking process
- **Smoother Streaming**: Better real-time response handling
- **Error Handling**: Clear, user-friendly error messages
- **Modular Services**: New assistant message generator service for code reuse
- **Auto Titles**: Intelligent conversation title generation after first AI response
- **Streaming Architecture**: Improved real-time event handling with cancellation support
- **Enhanced UI**: Better markdown rendering and reasoning box interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started as a Developer

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Get it running
pnpm install
pnpm dev       # Starts the app

# Development commands
pnpm test      # Run tests
pnpm lint      # Check code style
pnpm build     # Build for production
```

### How to Add New Features
1. **Start with Backend**: Add service logic in `src/main/services/`
2. **Add Communication**: Create IPC handlers in `src/main/ipc/`  
3. **Update State**: Modify Zustand stores in `src/renderer/src/stores/`
4. **Build UI**: Create React components using Chakra UI
5. **Connect Everything**: Use custom hooks to connect UI to backend

### New Services Architecture
- **Assistant Message Generator** (`assistant-message-generator.ts`): Unified streaming message generation
- **Title Generation** (`title-generation.ts`): Automatic conversation title generation
- **Enhanced IPC Events**: Real-time streaming events for better UX

### Code Organization
- **`src/main/`** - Backend logic (Node.js, database, AI integration)
- **`src/renderer/`** - Frontend UI (React, components, pages)
- **`src/shared/`** - Types and utilities used by both

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Chakra UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + SQLite + Electron
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK (OpenAI, o1, compatible providers)
- **State**: Zustand for simple, fast state management
